This project is governed by strict academic integrity standards. It is important to maintain honesty in all coursework activities. **Cheating, plagiarism, and any form of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated**. All coursework submissions must be original and completed by the individual student or team. The following guidelines apply:

   - Students are prohibited from copying code, text, or other content from external sources without proper citation.
   - All external resources used must be properly credited and referenced according to academic standards.

2. **Cheating Prohibition**:
   - Sharing or using unauthorized solutions, whether from previous years' coursework, third-party websites, or peers, is strictly forbidden.
   - Collaborating beyond the acceptable scope as defined by the course instructor is considered cheating.

3. **Consequences for Violations**:
   - Any student found violating the academic integrity policy will face consequences that may include, but are not limited to, failing the assignment, failing the course, or facing disciplinary action from the university.
   - All suspected violations will be reported to the instructor or appropriate academic body for review.
